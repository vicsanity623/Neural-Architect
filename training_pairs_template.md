# AI Training Pairs

You can copy and paste the following list into the **Auto Train** prompt in the Neural Architect dashboard. The format is "Input|Output". 

Format: `Trigger|Response`. Use this with **Auto Train** to teach Axiom basic interactions. (Customize this to your liking)

Begin one at a time until mastery is reached, then move on to the next. **For example**, begin with the first pair `Hello|Hi there`.then add the second pair but keep the first pair.`Hello|Hi there;Who are you?|I am an assitant`. then add the third pair but keep the first two pairs.`Hello|Hi there;Who are you?|I am an assitant;What are you?|I am artifically intelligent`. then save the model. repeat this process until mastery is reached.


**Do not attempt to use the full example list as this needs to be done one at a time in order for it to learn.**
